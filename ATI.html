          <p>Machine Learning (Machine Learning) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) aka <strong><em> "a subset (Mr.Clark 2025)."</em></strong><strong><em> "Being great at, being able to answer question based on the data it has available"</em></strong> in which that data is generated through <strong><em>"algorithirms, which can learn from themselves get different data, coming up with different things to solve that issue (Mr.Clark 2025),"</em></strong> improve their performance over time, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Machine Learning or Artifical Intellegence is a branch of computer science that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models which enable computers the abilites to perform tasks without explicit instructions. It involves the use of data and patterns to learn and make decisions, allowing machines to adapt and improve their performance over time on their own with out human interference.

        <h2><strong>Machine Learning in Data Security!</strong></h2>
        <p>The integration of machine learning into data security not only enhances threat detection but also <strong><em>"reduces false positives(Das 2025)."</em></strong> allowing security teams to focus on genuine threats.</p>

        Machine learning (Machine Learning) has become a crucial component in enhancing data security across various domains. By leveraging algorithms and statistical models, Machine Learning can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and predict potential threats. These models can run <strong><em>"so fast and can do each task so fast that you think the computer can do multiple things at a time (Mr.Clark 2025)."</em></strong></p> In conclusion, this field is never ending, and always needing to be imporved upon as hackers get smarter in finding loop holes or gaps in the firewalls or reaching the data.

        <h1><strong>History!</strong></h1>  
        <h3>Brief introduction to Machine Learnings Histroy</h3>
        <p>Machine Learning, though was first introduced in the 1940's, it's still <strong>"in its infancy (Mr.Clark 2025)."</strong> With early <strong>"neural network models, laying the groundwork for future developments (Mr.Clark 2025)."</strong> In the 1950s and 1960s, pioneers like Alan Turing and Frank Rosenblatt explored ideas around artificial intelligence and the perceptron, a simple neural network model. The 1980s saw a revival of neural networks with the introduction of backpropagation, enabling more efficient learning. In the 1990s, statistical approaches like support vector machines and decision trees gained popularity, marking a shift towards data-driven techniques. The 2000s and 2010s brought a revolution in machine learning through big data and deep learning, leading to advancements like image recognition and natural language processing. Today, machine learning continues to evolve, integrating with AI-driven applications in healthcare, cybersecurity, autonomous systems, and more. </p>
