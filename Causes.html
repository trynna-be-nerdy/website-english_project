            <h1><strong>What are some of the societal and individual impacts of data breaches?</strong></h1>
            <p> According to the research conducted by Lorenzaj (2024), data breaches can have significant societal impacts, inflicting issues on the people and the organizations. Since they have severe financial losses for individuals and businesses. Potentially leading to devastating effects on an individual, harming the personal privacy protection agreement the business signs for the protection of the customers. Furthermore, as data breaches become more common, leveraging advanced technologies like Machine Learning is essential to ensure the security and integrity of sensitive information. In 2023, the number of data compromises in the United States stood at 3,205 cases. Meanwhile, over 353 million individuals were affected in the same year by data compromises, including data breaches, leakage, and exposure(Lorenzaj 2024). While these are three different events, they have one thing in common. As a result of all three incidents, the sensitive data is accessed by an unauthorized individual. Moreover, due to the high number of individuals being impacted by countless data breaches, below is an image displaying the impact of data breaches.</p>

          <h2><strong>1. Increased Digital Dependence:</strong></h2>   
          <p> Growing reliance on cloud computing and digital services in everyday life. This rapid adoption of cloud computing has led to an increased dependence on digital services, making societies more vulnerable to cloud-related security threats. This is further proven by Lorenzaj in their research paper, "Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations manage and store their data, providing scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions for a variety of business needs (Lorenzaj 2024)." Furthermore, this reliance means that any disruption or breach can have widespread social impacts, affecting both individuals and organizations.   </p>

          <h2><strong>2. Lack of Cybersecurity Awareness:</strong></h2>
          <p>Mistakes made by users, such as weak passwords or improper data handling, can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. This is seen as many users and employees lack the necessary awareness and training to recognize security threats. This gap contributes significantly to data breaches, as human error often plays a role. This is further proven by Lorenzaj in their research paper, "Human errors, such as accidentally sharing sensitive files or failing to apply security patches promptly, can lead to significant vulnerabilities (Lorenzaj 2024)." Insufficient training in recognizing phishing attempts or proper data management increases the risk. </p>

          <p>Misconfigurations and negligence are common causes of data breaches, where users unintentionally expose data due to poor understanding of security protocols. This statement ids further proven by Lorenzaj in their research paper "Misconfigured access controls and improper data storage practices increase the risk of data breaches, particularly when cloud storage settings inadvertently allow public access(Lorenzaj 2024)." </p>

          <h1><strong>What are some of the National or Global impacts of data breaches?</strong></h1>

          <p> Data breaches have had significant economic impacts on organizations, primarily through direct financial losses such as fines, legal fees, and costs associated with recovery and remediation. Organizations that underinvest in security measures due to budget constraints often face higher expenses after a breach. These higher expenses overall end up affecting the people of the organization than the company itself, since these organizations can let go or even sue people for not doing their job attentively. Such instances of events happening, can overall affect the Nation leading to reforms of the governments to provide funds for those who were let go. For example, breaches have significant economic impacts on organizations, primarily through direct financial losses such as fines, legal fees, and costs. Organizations that underinvest in security measures due to budget constraints often face “higher expenses after a breach (Statista 2024).” For example, inadequate investment in robust cloud security can “lead to costly system upgrades and enhanced monitoring post-incident (Lorenzaj 2024).” Additionally, cybercriminals driven by financial incentives may deploy ransomware, demanding payment for data decryption, as seen in attacks that encrypt sensitive information and request ransom for its release. The release of such information can lead to a Global issue since the release of information can cause governments to quarrel potentially leading to more negative impacts for the people. Moreover, business disruptions caused by breaches also result in lost productivity and revenue, mainly when critical services are halted, reducing the pay to the employees. The cost of implementing and maintaining secure cloud environments is high, and budget limitations can prevent continuous updates, leaving systems vulnerable. The financial consequences of data breaches extend beyond immediate costs, impacting long-term business viability and reputations.

        <section>
          <h2><strong>1. Cost of Cloud Adoption:</strong></h2>   
          <p> Companies often choose cloud solutions to reduce operational costs, but this cost-driven approach sometimes leads to inadequate investment in security measures. These orgnaizations may priotorize and affordability over comprehensive security frameworks, leading to secutiry threats and gaps within the infrastructure. This is prove through a study conducted by oxford in which,Cloud environments are "complex, and misconfigurations can create significant security vulnerabilities(Alshathry 2024)." The complexity of cloud management often makes it easy for employees to overlook security best practices, causing data breaches.   </p>

          <p>Cybercriminals according to Statista have made nealy $1.5 Trillion USD, mkaing majority from stealing personal information for resale or demanding ransoms. Due to this economic factors drives persistent and sophisticated attack methods inflicting severe damage on an organizations data. Furthermore, examples of malware include "ransomware, which encrypts data and demands a ransom for its release, and keyloggers, which capture user credentials (Alshathry 2024)," often target cloud environments due to the valuable data stored within.

          <h2><strong>3. Budget Constraints:</strong></h2>    
          <p>Implementing robust cloud security can be costly, and some organizations lack the financial resources to continuously upgrade and maintain secure systems. This leads to further negative impacts of data security as organizations may not be able to afford the latest security technologies or hire skilled personnel. According to Lorenzaj, Implementing and maintaining machine learning infrastructure can be costly. Organizations may face budget constraints that limit their ability to invest in the necessary hardware and software(Lorenzaj 2024)." </p>

        <h1><strong>What are some of the Political or Community-level impacts of data breaches?</strong></h1>
        <p> Data breaches can have significant political or Comminity-level impacts, especially when they involve government institutions or critical infrastructure. Such breaches can expose sensitive national security information threatening the community, leading to vulnerabilities that threaten public safety and national defense. When state-sponsored cyberattacks are identified, they can escalate “political tensions” between nations, sometimes resulting in sanctions or diplomatic conflicts (Lorenzaj 2024). Additionally, breaches involving the personal data of citizens can undermine public trust in government institutions. Causing negative effects of the people, in relation to lesser positive evaluations of Congress and reduced support for government action to address a "range of domestic policy concerns.(Lorenzaj 2024)" Furthermore, governments may also face political pressure to implement stricter cybersecurity regulations, increasing the burden on both public and private sectors. A famous issue of such events unfolding was during Trump’s election in 2016 in which Russia had nearly hacked into the election campaign staging his win. Below is an image showing women voting and a black line is connected to the voting machine, the black line is a wire representing someone who could be sucking up information and then reintroducing it back into the machine changing the results of the election.

          <h2><strong>1. Regulatory Challenges:    </strong></h2>   
          <p> Regulatory challenges tend to impose great issues to the governments imposing a strict regulation inorder to protect the poeples personal data, but compliance can be complicated and costly for businesses. Failure to adhere can result in legal penalties, policitcal, and even economic challenge. Organizations must navigate a "complex landscape of data protection regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, which impose strict guidelines on data management(CrowdStrike 2024)."

          <h2><strong>2. Lack of Unified Cybersecurity Policies:
          </strong></h2>
          <p>
            Due to the each nations own policies against cyber crimes, causes counties to punish differently depending on the type of crime or the intended purpose. This results in goverments which are bias'ed against a sepcific nation or group will promote such crimes against them. Leading to fragmented approaches of data protection, "presenting a unique challenge, of data privacy and the shared responsibility model(CrowdStrike 2024)." This inconsistency makes it difficult to implement universally robust security measures.

          <h2><strong>3. Political Motivations for Attacks:
          </strong></h2>
          <p>
            Some cyberattacks are politically motivated, often launched by nation-state actors aiming to disrupt services or steal state secrets. This was primarly seen during Irans nuclear program issue in 2010, in which US government + Isreal had hacked Irans election inorder to sabotage them. Sophisticated cyberattacks, insider threats, and "vulnerabilities in cloud service configurations drive the increasing threat of data breaches in cloud environments (CrowdStrike 2024)." These politically charged attacks can have widespread societal and economic impacts, impacting the people of that nation.

          <h1><strong>What are some of the cultural or short/long-term implications implimented due to the issue of data breaches?</strong></h1>
          <p> Data breaches can significantly impact cultural elements within organizations and societies. One such cultural effect is the erosion of trust between companies and their customers, especially when sensitive personal data is compromised. In "organizational settings," a culture which does not prioritize cybersecurity awareness can lead to increased vulnerability (DeepInstinct 2025). Furthermore, the effects of such cultural issues directly effects the short & long-term implications of data protection for the coustomer. As if the employees are under trained, they may possibly be the biggest threat to preventing data breaches "inadvertently exposing data due to lack of training(Lorenzaj 2024)." Additionally, in multinational companies, varying cultural attitudes towards data privacy can create inconsistencies in security practices, making it challenging to implement a unified protection strategy for more long-term goals. The rise of remote work has also changed cultural norms around data access, as employees use personal devices and home networks, increasing the risk of breaches. In addition, in some cultures, there may be "reluctance to report data breaches promptly, fearing reputational damage, which can exacerbate the impact of security incidents (Lorenzaj 2024)." Below is an impage displaying the percentage of majority resasons as per why data breaches happen, being that 74% of the data breaches are due to "human element."

            <h2><strong>1. Company Culture:    </strong></h2>   
            <p> Organizations which do not foster a culture prioritizing cybersecurity often experience more breaches due to not having the infrastructure of staff to protect their data. As since if a organization does not "inadequate user training, can lead to human errors and increased susceptibility to insider threats and social engineering attacks (DeepInstinct 2025)." Resulting in the need for a strong security culture involving continuous education and awareness among employees.

            </strong></h2>
            <p>
              
              The rise of remote work has introduced new challenges as employees access sensitive data from less secure home networks. Furthermore, as the demand for remote work rises, relying "solely on perimeter defenses is increasingly ineffective (DeepInstinct 2025)." In otehr words, for relying on an under developed server for the organization data posses a severe risk of leakage, since hackers are able to gain access to the orginazations servers more easily. This shift requires adapting security policies to accommodate decentralized access, requring more advance infrastructures to handle the weakness in security.

            </strong></h2>
            <p>
              Global companies may face challenges when integrating cybersecurity practices across diverse cultural and regulatory environments. As organizations must ensure compatibility and data flow between disparate systems, which can require "extensive customization and can lead to potential vulnerabilities during the integration process (CrowdStrike 2024)." Moreover, differences in data privacy attitudes and practices between regions can result in inconsistent security measures casuing gaps in the system.
